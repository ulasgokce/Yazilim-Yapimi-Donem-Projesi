# E.W.L(English Words Learning) PROGRAM
Software Construction Term Project (Created By Ardanuc AKAR &amp; Ulaş GÖKÇE)
This is a program that makes you learn English words "Progressively".We make small quizz Until we make sure that you learn it.
Our mentality is "Learning is not a just one step learning is a series of steps so first and the best step to take is E.W.L".
This project was created for those who doesn't know many English words.
Our project is optimized for web browsers and mobile deviceses.
We used these coding languages JavaScript and C# Also for design we looked for CSS3 and HTML5.
Also we got help from some frameworks such as Boostrap4 JQuery AlertifyJS FontAwesome.
